_Maintenance Mode_ is a simple HTML template that can be used for a variety of odd jobs. I, personally, use it on my web server in place of generic 5XX error messages. It can also be easily tailored for use as a cpanel-skel placeholder for new sites. It's inspired by the Drupal maintenance mode page and is designed to be simple, elegant, and lightweight. Keeping with this concept, I highly recommend including any images in the document through base64 encoding. This will ensure that, so long as the server can deliver this page, images will also be delivered just fine - handy for when there is a 5XX server error.

## Installation
For **basic HTML**

Simply edit the title and message to suit your needs.
